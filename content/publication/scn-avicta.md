# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Nematicidal seed treatments are a relatively new strategy for managing plant-parasitic nematodes in row crops. Two such seed treatments, Avicta® (abamectin) and Clariva® (Pasteuria nishizawae), are marketed by Syngenta® for use against Heterodera glycines in soybean production in the upper Midwest. The specific effects of these seed treatments on the biology of the nematode have not been previously reported. The effects of Avicta and Clariva on H. glycines hatching, movement, attraction, penetration, development, and reproduction were determined in controlled-environment experiments. Avicta inhibited juvenile movement and penetration at the seed depth and 3 cm below the seed. Clariva inhibited juvenile movement and penetration 3 and 5 cm below the seed and nematode development within the roots of young plants. Both seed treatments affected nematodes in 10- and 20-day-old plants, but effects were not detected on nematodes developing in older plants (30 and 60 days) with larger root systems. These results provide details of the specific mechanisms of early season protection provided by Avicta and Clariva seed treatments."
